# Component Format

We are using below format for each components

-   `componentName.stories.mdx` - Will have Story about the respective component with all possible use cases

-   `ComponentName.module.scss` - Styles related to perticular components, detail Descriptions is available under <a href='?path=/story/style-system-styles--page'>Styles</a> folders in storybook

-   `ComponentName.jsx` - JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
    Need to import global config and utils if is common in .jsx file, else create a unique config and utils folders to specific components.

-   `Config` - Folders has data of respective component, eg: used in charts

-   `Utils` - Unique functions related to the components

-   `index.js` - It simplifies the imports because `index.js` file which imports the actual component itself, Find the example below:

    **with Index.js**

    > import Component from '../Component';
    >

    **without index.js** If you did not have an index.js file you would have had to do this to acess the file:

    > import Editable from '../ComponentFolder/ComponetJsx';
    >
